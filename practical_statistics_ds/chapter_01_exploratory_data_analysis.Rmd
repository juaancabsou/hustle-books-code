# Estimates of Location

Estimates of location are useful for exploring the data and finding the *typical value* for each feature, estimating where most of the data is located.

The main estimates of location are:
- **Mean (average)**: The sum of all values divided by the total number of values.

- **Weighted Mean**: The sum of all values multiplied by weights divided by the sum of weights.

- **Median (50th percentile)**: The middle value or the division of the 2 central values in a sorted list of values.

- **Weighted Median**: The value such that 1/2 of the sum of weights lies above and below the sorted data.

- **Trimmed Mean or Median**: The mean or median without extreme values.

```{r}
library(matrixStats)

state <- read.csv("~/DataAnalyticsBookCode/practical_statistics_ds/data/state.csv")


val_mean = mean(state[["Population"]])
val_mean_trim = mean(state[["Population"]], trim = 0.1)
val_median = median(state[["Population"]])
val_weight_mean = weighted.mean(state[["Murder.Rate"]], w=state[["Population"]])
val_weight_median = weightedMedian(state[["Murder.Rate"]], w=state[["Population"]])

print(paste0("Mean: ", val_mean))
print(paste0("Mean Trim: ", val_mean_trim))
print(paste0("Median: ", val_median))

print(paste0("Weighted Mean: ", val_weight_mean))
print(paste0("Weighted Mean: ", val_weight_median))

```
